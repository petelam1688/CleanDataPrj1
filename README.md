# Getting and Cleaning Data - #

---

## Course Project 1 ##

This project only contains 1 file called run_analysis.R which assume all the dataset to be local in the same file path.

The run_analysis.R achieves the following requirements:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Export the cleaned up data into a txt called tblDataFinal.txt

The following data files are needed:

1. subject_train.txt
2. X_train.txt
3. Y_train.txt
4. subject_test.txt
5. X_test.txt
5. Y_test.txt
